### Overview of Steam-Like Platform Using Microservices

Building a Steam-like platform as a microservices architecture in Python with FastAPI is a great choice for scalability, modularity, and rapid development. Steam's core features include game discovery, purchasing, social interactions, multiplayer, and user libraries. We'll design the system around **microservices**, where each service is independent, communicates via APIs or message queues, and can be scaled individually.

I'll first outline a comprehensive list of microservices (based on Steam's features, with educated guesses for completeness). Then, provide a **development roadmap**, **technology stack**, and **documentation for setup and running** the project.

#### Core Microservices
Here's a guessed set of essential microservices, covering user management, content, commerce, social, and backend support. Each service will be a separate FastAPI app, with its own database and API endpoints.

1. **User Service**  
   - Handles authentication (login/signup), user profiles, and basic account management.  
   - Key features: JWT tokens, password hashing, profile updates.

2. **Game Catalog Service**  
   - Manages the game library: adding games, metadata (descriptions, screenshots), genres, and search/indexing.  
   - Key features: CRUD for games, Elasticsearch integration for search.

3. **Review & Comment Service** (your "exam comment service" – assuming game reviews/comments)  
   - User-generated content: reviews, ratings, comments on games.  
   - Key features: Moderation, sentiment analysis, threaded replies.

4. **Shopping Service** (your "shopping service")  
   - E-commerce: Shopping cart, wishlist, promotions/discounts.  
   - Key features: Add/remove items, apply coupons.

5. **Purchase & Library Service**  
   - Processes orders, manages user libraries (owned games), and download links.  
   - Key features: Order history, game activation.

6. **Payment Service**  
   - Integrates with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe simulation).  
   - Key features: Transaction processing, refunds, invoice generation.

7. **Online & Multiplayer Service** (your "online service")  
   - Real-time status: Online friends, matchmaking, server status.  
   - Key features: WebSockets for live updates, lobby creation.

8. **Friends & Social Service**  
   - Social graph: Friend requests, chat, groups/clans.  
   - Key features: Graph database for relationships, basic messaging.

9. **Notification Service**  
   - Push notifications for achievements, sales, friend invites.  
   - Key features: Email/SMS integration, event-driven triggers.

10. **Recommendation Service**  
    - Personalized suggestions based on play history and reviews.  
    - Key features: ML models (e.g., collaborative filtering with scikit-learn).

11. **Achievement Service**  
    - Tracks user achievements and badges in games.  
    - Key features: Event ingestion from games, progress syncing.

12. **API Gateway Service**  
    - Single entry point: Routes requests to other services, handles auth, rate limiting.  
    - Key features: Load balancing, CORS.

13. **Monitoring & Logging Service** (supporting)  
    - Centralized logs, metrics, health checks.  
    - Key features: Prometheus integration.

Inter-service communication: Use **REST APIs** for synchronous calls (via HTTP) and **Kafka/RabbitMQ** for asynchronous events (e.g., "user purchased game" triggers library update).

### Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (for all services) – async, auto-docs with Swagger.
- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL (relational: users, purchases, games).
  - MongoDB (NoSQL: reviews, logs).
  - Redis (caching, sessions, real-time online status).
- **Message Broker**: Kafka (for events like notifications, achievements).
- **Search**: Elasticsearch (game search, recommendations).
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker (per service) + Kubernetes (for prod deployment).
- **API Tools**: Pydantic (models), SQLAlchemy (ORM for Postgres), Alembic (migrations).
- **Auth & Security**: JWT (PyJWT), OAuth2 (built into FastAPI).
- **Testing**: Pytest, coverage.py.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (or Jenkins).
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana.
- **Other Libs**: Celery (task queue), Uvicorn (ASGI server), requests (HTTP client).

All services will share a common Python 3.11+ environment.

### Development Roadmap

| **4. Social & Real-Time Services** | 3-4 weeks | - Online/Multiplayer, Friends/Social, Notification.<br>- WebSockets for online status.<br>- Event-driven comms with Kafka. | - Friend invites & basic chat.<br>- Real-time notifications. | Phase 3 |
| **5. Advanced Features** | 2-3 weeks | - Recommendation, Achievement.<br>- ML basics for recs.<br>- Moderation in Reviews. | - Personalized game suggestions.<br>- Achievement tracking. | Phase 4 |
| **6. Testing & Integration** | 2 weeks | - Unit/integration tests (80% coverage).<br>- End-to-end tests with Postman.<br>- Load testing (Locust). | - Test suite.<br>- Bug-free inter-service flows. | All prior |
| **7. Deployment & Monitoring** | 1-2 weeks | - Kubernetes setup (Minikube for dev).<br>- CI/CD pipeline.<br>- Add logging/monitoring. | - Prod-ready deploy.<br>- Dashboard for metrics. | Phase 6 |
| **8. Launch & Iteration** | Ongoing | - Beta testing.<br>- Scale based on usage.<br>- Add features (e.g., voice chat). | - MVP launch.<br>- User feedback loop. | Phase 7 |

**Total Estimated Time**: 16-23 weeks for MVP. Use Agile sprints (2-week cycles) for flexibility.

#### Setup & Running Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.11+.
   - Docker & Docker Compose.
   - PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch (via Docker Compose).
   - Git.

2. **Clone & Install**:
   ```
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd steam-clone
   pip install -r requirements-global.txt  # Shared tools
   pre-commit install  # For code quality
   ```

3. **Start Local Stack** (all services + infra):
   ```
   cp .env.example .env  # Edit as needed
   docker-compose up -d  # Starts DBs, Kafka, etc.
   ```

4. **Run Individual Services**:
   - For each service (e.g., user-service):
     ```
     cd services/user-service
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     alembic upgrade head  # Run migrations
     uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
     ```
   - Repeat for others (ports: 8001=User, 8002=Game, etc.).
   - API Gateway on port 8000 routes to all.

5. **Test the System**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Gateway Swagger).
   - Run tests: `pytest services/user-service/tests/`.
   - Health check: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Build Docker images: `docker build -t user-service:latest services/user-service/.`.
   - For Kubernetes: `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/`.
   - Use Helm for easier orchestration.

7. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Logs: `docker-compose logs -f`.
   - DB Migrations: Use Alembic per service.
   - Scaling: Add replicas in Docker Compose/K8s.

For full API docs, each service auto-generates Swagger at `/docs`. Contribute via PRs. If scaling to prod, add SSL, monitoring alerts, and backups.

This setup gives you a modular, extensible Steam clone. Start with Phases 1-2 for a quick prototype! If you need code snippets or diagrams, let me know.
